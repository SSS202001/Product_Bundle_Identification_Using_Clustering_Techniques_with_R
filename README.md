# Product Bundle Identification using Clustering Algorithms

This project focuses on identifying product bundles using clustering algorithms in R. It involves data preprocessing, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and implementing K-means, Hierarchical Clustering, and DBSCAN algorithms to cluster products based on sales data. The project aims to optimize marketing strategies by grouping products that are frequently purchased together.


## Project Structure
### 1. Data Preprocessing
Libraries Used:
tidyverse, lubridate, arules, cluster, factoextra, FactoMineR
Dataset Inspection:
Loaded and explored weekly sales dataset.
Performed data cleaning, outlier detection, and normalization.

### 2. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
Applied PCA to reduce dimensionality and extract key features.
Interpreted PCA results to understand variance explained and principal components.
Calculated silhouette width to evaluate initial clustering potential.

### 3. Clustering Algorithms
K-means Clustering:
Determined optimal clusters using the Elbow method.
Implemented K-means clustering and evaluated results using silhouette analysis.
Hierarchical Clustering:
Performed hierarchical clustering and visualized clusters using a dendrogram.
Selected clusters based on maximum distance threshold and evaluated clustering quality.
DBSCAN Clustering:
Implemented DBSCAN to identify clusters based on density.
Handled noise points and evaluated clustering quality using silhouette analysis.

### 4. Conclusion and Results
Summarized findings from each clustering algorithm.
Compared clustering methods to determine effectiveness for product bundle identification.
Selected DBSCAN as the final clustering model based on performance metrics.
